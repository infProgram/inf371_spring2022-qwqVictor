# Breakout

My final project for INF 371.

## Setup
You should pull the game down and run
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the dependencies. After that,
```
python3 main.py
```

## Help
Use <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> to control the bat.

You have 3 extra HP, once drop you lose one. If you dropped with no extra HP, you lose.  
With each brick removed you score one. But you can get extra score if you make combos.
With over 7 combos acheived, you can also recover 1 HP. If you are full of HP this time, you get 60 points score as compensation.

The only goal is to remove all bricks, and then you win. Each HP remaining at the time you won will give you 360 points.

The game has **sound effects**, please turn on your earphones or speaker to get full experience.
